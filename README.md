## Hi there, Welcome my github page.. 👋

### 👩‍💻 Some About Me's for You to Know 

I am Ceyda who after more than 2 years of brand management experience, switched her career into software development thanks to the bootcamp she completed at the end of 2020 in Ironhack Amsterdam.
You can know me as someone who works as a Jr. software engineer at Digital Turbine 5 days a week and also tries to improve during the day and on the weekends.

Apart from personal projects, you'll find some repos when I did at bootcamp in my github page.

### 💻 Languages and Tools:
I cannot say that I have a super knowledge of the languages and tools that I have shared below, but I am interested in them and try to have a deep knowledge.

Languages: Javascript, Typescript <br/>
Frontend part: HTML, CSS/SASS , ReactJs, Bootstrap, Material UI <br/>
Backend part: Express, Node Js <br/>
Data: Mongo DB-mongoose <br/>
Deployment: AWS(EC2, S3) ,Heroku


### 🥅 My goals for the upcoming year are:

- Starting a fullstack project where I can use the tools I've learned and learn new things.
- Renewing my portfolio.
- Having more proficiency in JS and react.
- Being a good at typescript.
- Knowing more about Computer Science topics.
